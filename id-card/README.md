# ID Card

In this project, you will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript. Your task is to create an improved clone of this [ID](https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/National-ID.jpg). The goal of this project is to expose you in advancing your skills without relying on existing frameworks. While this may help you enhance your technical skills, it is **HIGHLY** recommended to maximize the opportunity to level-up your soft skills too! Whenever you experience any kind of struggles, you found a discovery, share it with the community. Not only that you are helping them out, but you practice your verbal skills too!

Project Curriculum:
-
1. GitHub Familiarization
    - The official repository can be found [here](https://github.com/FWDP/beginner-challenges).
    - Send your Github email to any of FWDP admins here on Discord. They will give you write permissions for the project.
    - Ask a buddy/mentor on the process of cloning the repository but the general process is as follows:
        1. Clone the repository.
        2. Setup your development branch in the fomat `develop/{yourNameChoice}` where yourNameChoice is anything you like, could be your username.
        3. Add, commit and push changes **only** on your own branch.
        4. Select `id-card` and create your own folder.
2. Network Exposure
    - Join our discord servers to connect with your fellow web developer and gain real-time insights on their project updates.
    - Maximize the experience, get your network exposure level running! Connect with people and share!
3. Project Structure
    - This is not a requirement but is a good practice. You can use the template below as starting point on how to structure your project.
    - Prepare your project structure. Example:
   
        >&#128193;dduran19 <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&#128193;css <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8735;styles.css<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&#128193;js<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└scripts.js<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└ index.html
4. HTML
    - Use your existing knowledge in HTML to recreate the [ID](https://tribune.net.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/National-ID.jpg).
    - You don't have to create EVERYTHING at first. Start with the html structure of the id first. and then, later along the line, we'll add more features
5. CSS
    - NO existing frameworks are allowed (tailwind, bootsrap, etc.)
    - Use your creativity in making the id unique to your own. For complete beginners, you can follow the template temporarily and improve it along the way.
6. JavaScript
    - NO existing frameworks are allowed (React, Angular, etc.)
    - upon reaching this stage, you shall create a new HTML "component" where the user can input their details. Using javascript, you will connect the component in a way that when the submit button is clicked, the details on the ID will change.
7. MORE CSS 
    - improve your CSS skills by adding absolute positioning, animations, etc. Challenge yourself to make the form appear on TOP of the id.
8. API
    - Startup your API experience by creating a javascript function that uses this website: https://orcascan.com/guides/free-barcode-image-api-0e4a4fa6
    - Read the documentation on how to use it.
9. Adding more Features
    - Create a button that will allow the user to download their ID in an image format using [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) api.
10. Database
    - Below the download button, Create a list view of all "registered" users who made an ID.
